For my ICS 211 class, I wrote code to create a calculator that users can interact with using the console of the IDE (Eclipse). This programs allows you to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Using a stack or linked list, the program is able to sort the operands and operators in an order which solves the equation inputted by the user using PEMDAS (except it does not work with parentheses).

When executing the program, the console gives you 2 options: the linked list calculator or the stack calculator. Both options will create 2 linked lists or stacks in order to separate the operators and operands. However, they both essentially work in the same way in terms of the correctness of their calculations.
