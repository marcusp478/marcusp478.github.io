## Back at it again

I have not touched code in a very long time. Excluding the freeCodeCamp exercises and the practice WODs (Workout of The Day) we've done in class (ICS 314: Software Engineering) and on our own, the last time I typed a single line of code was probably a week or two before the end of the spring semester of 2022. 


## Fresh Material

As of the time I'm writing this, I only have experience with programming in Java, C, and C++ thanks to my high school and college classes. However, it is unfortunate to say that we will not be using any of that in this class. Instead we will be using something that is very new to me: Javascript. Luckily enough, the syntax is very similar to the aforementioned languages despite Javascript working differently in certain ways. For example, something that I'm genuinely surprised by is the fact that arrays can be indexed with characters rather than numerically as seen in the solution for one of the practice WODs we've been assigned. I also think that arrays not being limited to a fixed size is pretty cool and I have a feeling that it could come in handy in specific cases. 

## Final Thoughts

So far, the WODs seem to be helpful for those of us who aren't comfortable with coding or haven't done so in a long time. One of the goals for practicing these WODs is to get us to solve coding problems in a timely manner. Each of them has a "target time range" that represents the ideal amount of time it should take us to come up with a solution to the problem. In my humble opinion, the first two problems weren't difficult but definitely required at least a bit of time to think about before coming up with code to test. Even though being able to solve one specific problem isn't a strong indicator that you're close to having what it takes to pass the class or show competancy for the material, I believe that the "baby steps" that you take account towards the skill that you slowly, but surely, develop over time. 

I don't dislike Javascript and I don't get why people do (maybe I'm just uneducated on the matter). Just like with any other thing you learn, it will take time and effort to get used to it. The same thing happened when I was learning C and C++ in my ICS 212 class. Unlike Java, C and C++ utilizes pointers in order to change the value of a variable outside of the scope of its variable initialization and assignment. Similarly, I am still getting used to things like creating objects, nested objects, assigning a function to a variable, and so on in Javascript. Overall, I'm looking forward for what's to come next.
