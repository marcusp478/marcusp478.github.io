My experience in taking the class "ICS 314: Software Engineering I" was a combination of accomplishment and frustration. Throughout the semester, we've learned how to use new tools and about new concepts which we've applied and used for our final project. Now that we've finally finished our final projects, based on my current experience, I think that the key to being able to do software related projects are dependent on how much you actually learn and applying what you know that to your work. To demonstrate the things I've learned this semester, I will be talking about UI frameworks and coding standards.

## UI Frameworks

A user interface framework, or UI framework, is a collection of pre-made libraries and tools that essentially make it easier for you to implement the design of the user interface by reducing the amount of code you need to write in order to accomplish doing so. When we were first learning HTML around the beginning of the semester, we had no frameworks to work with and implemented web pages purely with raw HTML. With my experience in both using React Bootstrap and just HTML on its own, I can safely say that frameworks definitely save you a lot of time considering that you usually don't need to mess around with CSS as often. However, although there is a learning curve for using things like Bootstrap, the advantages make it too good to be disregarded when working on any type of software project.
