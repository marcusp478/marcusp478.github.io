<p>These past couple of weeks included my first ever experiences with HTML and CSS. To be completely honest, I did not think it would be as hard as it is. Learning them is pretty straightforward but the difficult part is learning and getting used to all the tools you have available for you. From these experiences, I’ve learned that creating webpages is especially difficult due to how tedious the process is. However, frameworks cut down the tedious-ness by providing classes that potentially replaces a large percentage of CSS code you would’ve written without it. As good as that may sound, there is also a learning curve for frameworks such as Bootstrap, which is something I’ve struggled with these past few days.</p>

<h2 id="hands-on-experience">Hands on Experience</h2>

<p>One of the more notable experiences of my Bootstrap journey so far was doing the assignment where we had to choose a website and then recreate it to the best of our ability using Bootstrap. For this assignment, I chose to recreate <a href="https://ch.tetr.io">https://ch.tetr.io/</a>, which seemed pretty difficult to implement. Unfortunately, that manifested itself and became true. I spent a good chunk of the day trying to figure out how to make something similar to the original. The biggest issues I had while doing the assignment was with alignments, margins, and paddings. Namely, at one point there was a huge whitespace between the footer and the body due to huge margins and paddings coming from elements that seemed relatively far away from the whitespace itself. One of the solutions I had in mind was to adjust those values manually using CSS, but to my surprise, it did not work. After a while of trying different things, I eventually opted to start over. That’s when I realized how useful the ‘container’, ‘row’, and ‘col’ classes from Bootstrap are. The ‘row’ and ‘col’ elements allows you to align things side by side, and from my understanding, ‘container’ ensures that all the elements inside of it are all within the defined space without leaking out. The use of ‘container’ resolved the issue I had since it prevented the margins of an element from leaking past the space I defined them in. Overall, I’d like to believe that the use of these Bootstrap tools kept me from writing even more CSS than I already did.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-i-learned">What Have I Learned?</h2>

<p>Overall, Bootstrap 5 is pretty useful since it provides you with tools that save you from implementing simple, yet tedious formatting options for your webpage. With the vast library that comes with it, the learning curve is indeed large. It can be a bit annoying at times when things aren’t being formatted the way you want it to, but based on my experience, that’s probably just the usual when using HTML and CSS. Another take away from this experience is that searching things up and educating yourself is important if you don’t want to waste time all day playing around with things you don’t completely understand. A lot of what I used were copied from the Bootstrap website and I just trusted that they’d work the way I assumed it did. Take this line of HTML using Bootstrap for example:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;</code></p>

<p>Clearly, it creates a navbar that you can use to store different elements in. However, I think it would be useful to know what each class does to format the navbar. For example, the ‘bg-light’ makes the color of the navbar a light gray. If you wanted to change the color somehow, knowing this would be important.</p>
